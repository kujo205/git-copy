## Installation

You must have npm installed in order to install this script.


### Basic installation

```bash
npm install -g git-remote-copy
```


And use it like 
```bash
git-remote-copy https://github.com/kujo205/kujo205/blob/main/README.md .
```

or you can also add it as git alias, which looks cooler.


### Adding command as git alias

Then enter your global git config file by running 
```bash
 git config --global --edit
```

Modify this file in the editor of your choice (I use vim, please check some guide if you struuggle with this). And add the line
```bash
  copy = "!git-remote-copy"
```
to alias area

After this you can use this command as if it is default git command
